# Decentralized-AI-Powered-Identity-Verification-System
A blockchain-based system that uses AI (e.g., facial recognition or document OCR) to verify users and store tamper-proof identity proofs on-chain or through IPFS.

Technologies:
1. AI: OpenCV, Tesseract, or a custom facial recognition model
2. Blockchain: Ethereum or Polygon, IPFS for storage
3. Smart Contracts: Solidity
4. Frontend: React
5. Why it shines: Demonstrates real-world utility in KYC (Know Your Customer) and digital identity, hot topics in Web3 and FinTech.
